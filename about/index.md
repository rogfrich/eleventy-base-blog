  <p class="mt-3">
  I’m a Geordie, deep undercover in Yorkshire (don’t tell anyone, they think I’m one of them…)
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-3">
  I work in IT for a financial services company. I’ve been a hobbyist coder for quite a while - my job doesn’t involve programming, but I do work closely with the dev teams and I’ve picked up a few things here and there. Most of my coding is self-taught, and tends to be system-admin type scripts in Python, with a little bit of server-side web stuff as well (mostly Django).
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-3">
  I’m exited to be on the Coder’s Guild JAMstack course, because my front-end knowledge is very limited, and my JS knowledge is non-existent (well, I can make an alert box pop up, that’s something).
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-3">
  Non-techie hobbies include photography, playing guitar and fixing typos.
